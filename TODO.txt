----

	- [x] journal related fields (e.g. journal:journal) in custom fields
	- [ ] thesis related fields

Next
----

- [ ] add put_record to rdmutil
- [ ] Implement a CrossRef to Invenio RDM record
	- [ ] Add option to save in dataset collection
- [x] Figure out a faster way to retrieve RDM ids without using the API or OAI-PMH. Possibly options would be to create an rdmapid service, or direct query via PostgreSQL. 
	- PostgREST can provide a RESTful JSON API to our Invenio RDM data stored in Postgres

Someday, maybe
