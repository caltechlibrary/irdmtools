Bugs
----

- [x] I'm getting a response timeout after 100 to 500 records, retrying ther request yields a successful fetch, need to implement some sort of retry
- [ ] doi2rdm missing metadata attributes, test DOI "10.1063/5.0122760", compared with `doi2eprintxml -simple "10.1063/5.0122760" | jq .[0]`
	- [ ] .metadata.publication_date is not completing the crosswalk
	- [ ] .metadata.description is not completing the crosswalk
	- [ ] .metadata.rights is not completing the crosswalk
	- [ ] .metadata.subjects is not completing the crosswalk
	- [ ] .metadata.publisher has wrong value
	- [x] .metadata.creators is not completing crosswalk in doi2rdm but does in doi2eprintxml saved as simple record.
		- cut and paste error, putting creators in contributor field


Next
----

- [ ] add put_record to rdmutil
- [ ] Implement a CrossRef to Invenio RDM record
	- [ ] Add option to save in dataset collection
- [ ] Figure out a faster way to retrieve RDM ids without using the API or OAI-PMH. Possibly options would be to create an rdmapid service, or direct query via PostgreSQL. 
- [x] decide if resource types CSV should have a header line, update eprint2rdm if needed
- [x] add option to save result directly in a collection from eprint2rdm
- [x] add option to iterate overy many EPrint IDs saving to a dataset collection from eprint2rdm
- [x] implement a EPrints to RDM utility that supports customizable resource type mapping
- [x] Implement a first pass at a harvester
- [x] Figure out a way to retrieve RDM ids without using the API. The API max results returned is 10K and we're going to have many more records than that (e.g. OAI-PMH)
- [x] Need to discuss with Tom is we really want to bother with rdm2eprint crosswalk, I can implement it but I'm not sure it is necessary

Someday, maybe
--------------

- [ ] Go's "x" packages include "rate" which implements a rate limiter, look at for RDM API
