# Library Widgets

This site provides library content in various aggregations and formats. Sometimes the content isn't structured the way you want for your webpage.  How do you customize the content easily? That is where [Widgets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_widget) come in. The term [widget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget_(economics\)) comes from economics meaning an object or device that does something as a generic term. Our widgets are software devices that are intended to help you re-use and re-purpose library content.
