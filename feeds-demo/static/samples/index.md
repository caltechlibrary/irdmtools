# Samples, examples and formats

## Samples

Explore samples organized by use cases based around Caltech [People](people.html) and [Groups](groups.html).  Each set is organized into base problem, solution approach, code example. The code examples includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript for embedding the results in your webpages. An additional set of older examples looks at using "JSON" and "HTML include" feed formats.

+ Older [examples and formats](examples-and-formats.html)

If you want to skip programming try our experimental [Builder Widget](/widgets/builder-widget.html) can be used to generate the HTML and JavaScript you need to include our content in your webpage. The [year list](year-list-demo.html) example shows the type of code it generates.

## Feed Formats available

This site supports six content formats for each feed provided.  The formats are JSON, Markdown, HTML, HTML include, BibTeX and RSS.  The easiest to use is probably **HTML include**. You can cut and paste the version into an existing webpage as is. It is however not terribly flexible beyond inserting into an existing web page and styling the CSS classes and attributes.  

### Flexible feed formats

+ [JSON](json.html) is the most flexible format for working with structured data in languages like [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript), [Python](https://www.python.org), and [R](https://r-poject.org). Our JSON feeds include the greatest amount of metadata we harvest from our various repositories. If you want fine grain control over analyzing or rendering your content this is a good format to work with.
+ [Markdown](markdown.html) is a format that many web content systems can use to turn into HTML and it is easier to ready and modify than raw HTML. 
+ [BibTeX](bibtex.html) is an old format used with LaTeX to manage bibliographies. 
+ [RSS](rss.html) is a news aggregator format. It is used by news aggregators, content management systems and some search engines


## Aggregations available 

This site aggregates content from Caltech Library repositories. 

+ [CaltechAUTHORS](https://authors.library.caltech.edu)
+ [CaltechTHESIS](https://thesis.library.caltech.edu) 
+ [CaltechDATA](https://data.caltech.edu)
+ more will be included over time

Each repository system also breaks down its publications into types. E.g CaltechAUTHORS hosts articles, books and book sections, conference proceedings publication types; CaltechTHESIS includes thesis and dissertations; CaltechDATA hosts dataset and source code associated with groups and individual do research at Caltech.  We provide a one stop shop for content and format (e.g. we include JSON versions of all the content we harvest).  For each individual repository we provided a combined view of the contents types as well as individual aggregations of types.  We provide this grouped by both Caltech [People](/people) and [Groups](/groups).
