### Rate Limits

The rate limits for OAI-PMH identifier lists is per minute.

The rate limits for OAI-PHM records is per hour.

The rate limits for REST API records appear to be 500 per minute and 5000 per hour with a distant reset.

## rdmapid

The idea of replicating a similar local API that is fast and responsive like I was able to do with eprinttools' ep3apid is intreaguing. The question is what would make it more compelling than RDM's native REST API or OAI-PMH? AmI  really justified in building it?

It will be important to answer the following questions before proceeding.

1. How hard is it to crosswalk a record from raw PostgreSQL tables (generated by RDM's ORM) to a simplified record struct?
2. How hard is it to replicate the PostgreSQL databases from the docker containers to a data warehouse instance of PostgreSQL?
3. What web API is most compelling?
    a. Custom (e.g. URL contains verbs for actions)
    b. RESTful?
    c. GraphQL?

### Reference

- GraphQL Go packages
    - [graphql-go](https://github.com/graph-gophers/graphql-go), server implementation, focus on easy of use, scheme based approach
    - [eggql](https://github.com/andrewwphillips/eggql) an easy GraphQL server library that can be implemented schemelessly
    - [gqlgen](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen) a Go GraphQL generator
